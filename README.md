# Titlecase Library for Haskell

This library offers fairly robust `titlecase` function to capitalize a string
to English Title Case. Unlike `toTitle` from the `text` library -- which simply
capitalizes the first letter of every word -- this function respects rules with
regard to articles, conjunctions, and prepositions.

It is available from Hackage at <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/titlecase>.
